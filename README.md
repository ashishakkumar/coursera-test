<h3 style="font-family: BROADWAY; text-align: center;font-size: 25px; color: blueviolet;">My window experience</h3>
<p style="font-family: candara; text-align: left;font-size: 20px; color: brown; margin-left:40px; margin-right: 40px;">I have seen a small town transforming into a large district. There was no significant change in the area, but the population growth was exponential. I recall those days when I observed the world with transcendent curiosity, childhood. Through a window on the ground floor of my home, a blend of budding industrialization and struggling mother nature could be seen. I still remember that there were enough trees to sustain any heatwave and quell people's hunger by offering their gifts. As the population boomed, the arrogation of land by humans increased. The beautiful sunset up to the horizon could also be observed through the window in those days. The playground evident from the window gratified the basis of early childhood of all the residents. However, that was not the government's property and was gobbled up by a logistics company. One appreciable step taken by the authority was that the industries were shifted to another part of the city to intend urban planning. The population boom continued over time. Those trees were replaced by concrete mountains seizing the lovely sunset view. The window from which I could watch those sparrows chirping, the flight pattern of migratory birds, and waiving to my friend at his house, is now preserved only as beautiful memories. But the fact is that I never feel nostalgic because of them for not existing in the present era. They are still realistic, only the place has changed. Yes, in my village, they are living, being nurtured too, and are livelier. When I was pursuing my higher education, I shifted to another town that transmogrified my thinking.
Home is not a place; home is a feeling. This time the experiences through the new window were like the sequel of my past experiences. See the evanescence of this so-called developing world! Snatching flora from its mother, our mother nature, is not considered a major offense by humans and is repeatedly done. But Mother Nature has her laws. She knows how to maintain the balance, which is evident from the historical phenomena. It is told that- "Until we don't experience, we don't believe it completely. Some intelligent beings are trying to explain the insight of what wrong we have done to nature, and measures are also being taken. And I am optimistic about my notion that everyone's charming window's experience doesn't end like a memory but remains lively forever.
